# Decoder Ring Project

> This is an assignment for the Thinkful Software Engineering Program. It required the creation of three different algorithms that encode and decode messages. These three algorithms used the following methods: caesar shift, polybius square, and substitution cipher.

## Learning Objectives

-Test-driven development with unit testing using Mocha & Chai, to ensure robust functionality at every level

-Building complex algorithms using advanced Javascript functions

-Writing clean, easy-to-read code in an organized manner
